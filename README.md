# AI Sovereignty: A Boundary-Based Protection Framework

This repository accompanies the research work **“AI Sovereignty: A Boundary-Based Protection Framework”** by Hui-Pi Lin (NOIRÉA).

It serves as a **research architecture and proposal-level reference**, outlining conceptual structures, boundary principles, and protocol designs for preserving human decision-making sovereignty in hybrid human–AI systems.

This repository is intended to complement the corresponding **arXiv preprint** and to provide a transparent view of the architectural and normative scope of the work.

## Scope and Intent

This repository documents:

- A **boundary-based research framework** for AI sovereignty  
- Architectural concepts grounded in the Ø (Null-State) framework  
- Human-upholding and recovery-oriented protocol designs  
- Proposal-level structures intended for academic discussion and future extension  

It is **not**:

- A production-ready software system  
- A finalized technical standard  
- A regulatory or legal specification  

The materials here are provided to support scholarly analysis, critique, and interdisciplinary discussion.

## Relationship to the arXiv Preprint

The arXiv paper presents the formal academic argument, analysis, and case evaluation.

This repository provides:
- Structural and architectural context
- High-level representations of system boundaries
- Protocol abstractions referenced in the paper

Readers should treat this repository as a **conceptual and architectural companion**, not as an independent or complete implementation.
